This project implements a content-based movie recommender system using cosine similarity. The system suggests movies to users based on similarities between movies in terms of their attributes such as genre, cast, and keywords. The dataset used is derived from The Movie Database (TMDB)


Methodology
Cosine Similarity: Movies are represented as vectors based on their attributes. Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between these vectors.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the TMDB dataset to extract relevant movie attributes.

Implementation: The recommender system is implemented in Python using pandas for data handling and scikit-learn for cosine similarity computation.

Usage
